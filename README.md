# Pose Detection OPENCV

In this project we develop a code for detecting a live pose of a person. Person can perform this thing through video, picture and through webcam also.

We used the `PyCharm IDE` to write and perform the task.

Through `mediapipe` module of python we can able to trace the body nodes and with the help of this module only we are connecting those node.

## Modules used:
* numpy
* mediapipe
* OPENCV(cv2)

## To check the person POSE
run a following command in terminal of pycharm
```
python main.app
```
## Deployment
```
1. Load the necessary Modules
2. Initialize the function of the Modules
3. Setting the parameters of the initialized function
4. Run a infinite loop for the video or webcam.
5. resize if you want.
6. and then apply that initialized function on the video.
7. and show that video or webcam.
```
